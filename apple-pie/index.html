   <H3> This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!</H3>

  <h4>
    1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in 
    flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce
    temperature and let simmer. 
    2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a 
    lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
    that it does not run off. 
    3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
    degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
